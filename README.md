# Spotify-viewer
Basic ui that displays your current spotify listening status

To use, you must have nodejs installed. Once installed, run "npm i express querystring" in a terminal.
After you have the required packages, open a command prompt window in the same directory as the app.js file and run "node app.js"

Remember to configure before running!! This app requires that you enter your own client seed and client secret, which can be obtained at developer.spotify.com by creating your own spotify app. 

Unfortunately, due to spotify's api, the only feature of this that can be used without Spotify Premium is viewing what song you are currently listening to. If you have premium, you have access to use the pause button and skip buttons.
